# UTM Discovery Error Fix - Summary

## Issue
The `/api/debug-utm-fields` endpoint was throwing a `TypeError: e.value?.toLowerCase is not a function` error when processing GHL custom fields.

## Root Cause
Some custom field values in GoHighLevel are not strings (they can be numbers, booleans, objects, or null/undefined). The code was attempting to call `.toLowerCase()` on these non-string values without proper type checking.

## Solution Applied
Updated the `/api/debug-utm-fields/route.ts` file with comprehensive type checking:

1. **Field Value Type Checking**
   - Added explicit null/undefined checks before string operations
   - Verified values are strings before calling `.toLowerCase()`
   - Used `String(value)` conversion when adding to sample sets

2. **Categorization Safety**
   - Added type guards in all filter operations
   - Ensured field names are strings before processing
   - Protected all `.toLowerCase()` calls with type checks

3. **Specific Changes**
   ```typescript
   // Before (unsafe):
   field.value?.toLowerCase().includes(pattern)
   
   // After (safe):
   field.value !== null && 
   field.value !== undefined && 
   typeof field.value === 'string' && 
   field.value.toLowerCase().includes(pattern)
   ```

## Testing Instructions

1. **Clean and Rebuild** (if needed):
   ```bash
   # Run the cleanup script
   ./clean-and-rebuild.bat
   ```

2. **Start Dev Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test the Fix**:
   ```bash
   # Run the test script
   ./test-utm.bat
   
   # Or test manually by visiting:
   http://localhost:3000/api/debug-utm-fields
   ```

## Expected Results
- No more `toLowerCase is not a function` errors
- Successful discovery of UTM and campaign tracking fields
- Proper handling of all field value types (strings, numbers, booleans, null, etc.)

## Additional Notes
- The Lead Finder page itself wasn't directly causing the error
- The error was occurring during debug/diagnostic runs
- This fix ensures all debug endpoints handle various data types gracefully
- The same type-checking pattern should be applied to any other endpoints that process custom fields

## Files Modified
- `/src/app/api/debug-utm-fields/route.ts` - Added comprehensive type checking

## Files Created for Testing
- `/test/test-utm-discovery.js` - Node.js test script
- `/test-utm-discovery.ps1` - PowerShell test script  
- `/test-utm.bat` - Batch file to run the test
- `/clean-and-rebuild.bat` - Cleanup and rebuild script
